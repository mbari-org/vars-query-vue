When an annotation is selected, the corresponding video will appear in the video player on the right, queued to the time of the annotation. The video can be toggled to an external player using the arrow icon in the lower left ( :octicons-link-external-16: ).

The video player has limited functionality. It has standard playback controls like play and pause, and users can skip forward or backward by 15 seconds.
