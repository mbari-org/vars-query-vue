# Search by Deployment

# Overview

Before you begin searching with the query tool, make sure your system is properly configured. Please follow instructions on the [Getting Started](doc_getting_started.md) page to ensure your settings are correctly set up.

Once configuration is complete, this section will guide you through the basic steps of running a search based on concepts.

## Deployment Overview ##

Users can search the VARS database by deployment, or dive, to view all observations annotated during a specific deployment. Begin typing the deployment ID in the “Deployment” search box under the **Annotation and Deployment** section of the query. The selection options update as you type. Click on a name to select it. <span style="color:#F5c639;">(Step 1 in image below)</span>

!!! note "Deployment Identification Numbers"
    - ROV deployments can be searched by the ROV name and dive number. These need to be in 4-digit numbers (e.g. Doc Ricketts 1429). 
    - AUV deployments can be searched by name of the platform and date (e.g. Daphne 2 20240318).
    - Other platforms use labels based on the specific projects (e.g. Coral Observatory 202106).

Once a deployment is selected, add the term to the current query by pressing the <span style="color:#4488ed;">**blue **+** button**</span> on the right. <span style="color:#F5c639;">(Step 2 in image below)</span>  The deployment should be visible in a <span style="color:#60aaa8;">**colored search chip**</span> below the search box. Deployments can be removed from a search by clicking the **“x”** located on each chip. Multiple concepts can be added to the query by repeating this process.

Once all constraints have been specified, press the <span style="color:#2095f2;">**blue search button**</span> on the floating banner to run your query. <span style="color:#F5c639;">(Step 3 in image below)</span>
