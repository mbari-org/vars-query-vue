A query can be constrained by the date for an observation. An *observation date* is the date the annotation itself was made. This is different from the recorded date. Dates and times are in UTC.

Observation dates can  also be selected using the calendar function on the right side of the entry field. Dates can be entered as a range or a singular date. To constrain to one day, choose the same date for the start and the end of the date range.
