# Quickstart Query #

The Quickstart Query provides a simple way to begin exploring MBARI’s annotation data. Use this page to perform basic searches by concept name or deployment number.


Before you begin searching with the query tool, make sure your system is properly configured. Please follow instructions on the [Getting Started](doc_getting_started.md) page to ensure your settings are correctly set up. This step only needs to be completed the first time visiting the site.

Once configuration is complete, this section will guide you through the basic steps of running a search based on concepts.

More advanced search options are explained in detail under [User Guide](https://docs.mbari.org/internal/vars-query-vue/doc_01_general_info/).
