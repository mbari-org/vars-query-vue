### *Deployment Identification Numbers* ###


-   **ROV Deployments** can be searched by the ROV Name and dive number (these also need to be  4-digit numbers, e.g. Doc Ricketts 0013).

     *   Doc Ricketts
     *   Mini ROV
     *   Tiburon
     *   Ventana
 

<br>

-   **AUV Deployments** are categorized by name of the platform and date (YYYYMMDD). The exception in this style of identification is the Galene Optim, which is in order of deployment.  

??? info "Registered AUVs in VARS"

     *   Ahi (1, 2)
     *   Daphne (1, 2)
     *   Galene Optim

     *   Makai (1, 2, aft, forward)
     *   Pontus (1, 2)
     *   Triton 47
