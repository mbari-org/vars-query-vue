## *Adding Deployments and Camera Platforms* ## 

### *Deployments* ###

 **Deployments** that have been registered in the VARS database can be used to constrain a query.
 
#### *Deployment Identification Numbers* ####


-   **ROV Deployments** can be searched by the ROV Name and dive number (these also need to be  4-digit numbers), e.g. Doc Ricketts 0013
Other platforms use labels based on the original operator’s naming convention. 

??? note "Registered ROVs in VARS"

     *   Doc Ricketts
     *   Mini ROV
     *   Tiburon
     *   Ventana
 


-   **AUV Deployments** are categorized by name of the platform and date (YYYYMMDD). The exception in this style of identification is the Galene Optim, which is in order of deployment.  

??? note "Registered AUVs in VARS"

     *   Ahi (1, 2)
     *   Daphne (1, 2)
     *   Galene Optim
     *   Makai (1, 2, aft, forward)
     *   Pontus (1, 2)
     *   Triton 47


-   **Other Deployments** include equipment specific to particular labs  that use labels based on their internal naming convention.
    - ArcticRays
    - Coral Observatory
    - Macro Coral Cam
    - Station M Tripod



Once a deployment is entered, add the term to the current query by pressing the <span style="color:#4488ed;">**blue **+** button**</span> on the right. The selection should be visible in a <span style="color:#60aaa8;">**colored search chip**</span> below the search box. Details can be removed from a search by clicking the “x” located on each chip.
