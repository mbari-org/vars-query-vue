## *Selecting a Concept* ##

Concepts are selected from a database of all formal and common taxonomic, geologic, and technical names. Begin typing a name in the “Concepts” search box under the **Annotation and Deployment** section of the query. The selection options update as you type. A full list of concepts is located in [Appendix A](appendix_a.md). Alternatively, you can scroll through a drop-down list of available concepts in alphabetical order. Click on a name to select it. 

!!! note
    If you do not select a concept parameter, you will be query the entire VARS database.  This will cause the query to fail.

In the example below, the concept *Gersemia* has been selected.

Once a concept is selected, add the term to the current query by pressing the <span style="color:#4488ed;">**blue **+** button**</span> on the right. The concept should be visible in a <span style="color:#60aaa8;">**colored search chip**</span> below the search box. Hovering over the <span style="color:#60aaa8;">colored chip</span> shows all the concepts that will be added to the query. Concepts can be removed from a search by clicking the **“x”** located on each chip. Multiple concepts can be added to the query by repeating this process.
