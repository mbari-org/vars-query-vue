The image grid can be adjusted to show 1 to 6 images per row. Each image will enlarge when you click on it. There are also options to enlarge the jpg or png under each image grid. Click on the image again to go back to the image grid. The video can be accessed by clicking the video camera icon (:material-video:). This opens in a new window so be sure to check your pop-up settings in your browser if it does not appear.
