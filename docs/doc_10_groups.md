A *group* indicates additional information to categorize annotations within the VARS database. The groups are linked to a camera platform. Additional information can include project-based efforts or machine learning aspects used to distinguish the annotations from standard core data. You can constrain your search by one or more groups selected from the drop-down menu. Groups can also be typed into the search field then selected to avoid scrolling through the menu.

Groups are automatically added to the query once selected (a check mark) within the drop down menu. Each group should be visible in a <span style="color:#60aaa8;">**colored search chip**</span> within the *groups* search field. Individual groups can be removed from a search by clicking the <span style="color:#60aaa8;">**“x”**</span> located on each chip.  The entire field can be reset by clicking the white **"x"** on the right that becomes visible when hovering over the field.
