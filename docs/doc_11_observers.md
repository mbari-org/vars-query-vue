An *observer* can be added to constrain your search by a particular annotator (e.g., lemon), vessel crew (e.g., ventana), or model generator (e.g., mbari452K) entered in the VARS database. You can constrain your search by one or more observers. These names can be typed into the search field then selected from the drop-down menu.

??? note "VARS Observers"

    VARS observers are all users that have a VARS login. A new user login can be created through the [VARS Annotation Interface.](https://docs.mbari.org/vars-annotation/)

Group entries are automatically added to the query once selected (a check mark) within the drop down menu. Each group should be visible in a <span style="color:#60aaa8;">**colored search chip**</span> within the *groups* search box. Individual groups can be removed from a search by clicking the <span style="color:#60aaa8;">**“x”**</span> located on each chip.  The entire field can be reset by clicking the <span style="color:white;">**"x"**</span> on the right that becomes visible when hovering over the field.
