# General Information and Definitions

## Definitions
 
The **VARS Query** allows easy searching of the observations stored in MBARI’s video annotation database. Complex queries can be made by constraining concept, temporal, spatial, or physical parameters (e.g. species, season, location, or depth). The VARS query references the knowledgebase (see below). Query results can be saved as tabular text data or images (where they exist).
 
The **VARS Knowledgebase** is an extensible database of biological, geological, and technical terms used to describe deep-sea research conducted by the institute.  This database is composed of identifiable objects called *concepts* (e.g. organisms, equipment, sediment types, etc.). The knowledgebase also contains *associations* which serve as descriptors that can be connected with the objects being annotated (e.g. colors, size, behaviors). 

A **concept** is the name of the physical object in an observation.
 
An **association** is a descriptor for a concept being observed. Each descriptor must be connected to a concept observation. Multiple associations may be used to describe one observation. A concept can have multiple associations to describe the observation.
