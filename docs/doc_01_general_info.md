# General Information and Definitions

 The **VARS Query** allows easy searching of the observations stored in MBARI’s video annotation database. Complex queries can be made by constraining concept, temporal, spatial, or physical parameters (e.g. species, season, location, or depth). The VARS query references the knowledgebase (see definition below). Query results are delivered as a table and include the concept and associations, image links, physical and ancillary data, dive information, and tape information. Query results can be saved as tabular text data or images (where they exist).

## *Definitions*
 
**VARS** (Video Annotation and Reference System) is a software interface and database system that provides tools for describing, cataloging, retrieving, and viewing the visual, descriptive, and quantitative data associated with MBARI’s deep-sea video archives.

The **VARS Knowledgebase** is an extensible database of biological, geological, and technical terms used to describe deep-sea research conducted by the institute.  This database is composed of identifiable objects called *concepts* (e.g. organisms, equipment, sediment types, etc.). The knowledgebase also contains *associations* which serve as descriptors that can be connected with the objects being annotated (e.g. colors, size, behaviors). 


A **concept** is the name of the physical object in an observation.
 
An **association** is a descriptor for a concept being observed. Each descriptor must be connected to a concept observation. Multiple associations may be used to describe one observation. A concept can have multiple associations to describe the observation.
