Activities are automatically added to the query once selected within the drop down menu. Each activity should be visible in a <span style="color:#60aaa8;">**colored search chip**</span> within the *activities* search field. Individual activities can be removed from a search by clicking the <span style="color:#60aaa8;">:octicons-x-circle-16:</span> located on each chip.  The entire field can be reset by clicking the white :oticons-x-circle: on the right that becomes visible when hovering over the field.
