The results page of the query defaults to a summary view of returned annotations. This includes a map (top left) and video player (top right) with a table list of returned annotations underneath. The map and video can be adjusted for ease of browsing.

!!! info "Map and Video Player Adjustments"

     *   The **Hide map and video** checkbox will entirely hide the map and video. The check boxes will still be visible for use.
     *   The **Compact map and video** checkbox will make the map and video player smaller on the page. The funtionality of the playback toolbar for the video player becomes unusable
     *   The **Float map and video** checkbox will allow the map and video to remain on the top of the page while scrolling through the table below.

!!! tip "Tip"

     *   You can combine the use of both the *compact view* and the *float view* for better browsing.
